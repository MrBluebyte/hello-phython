# Hello Python

## Purpose
This repository was created to evaluate my GitHub skills as part of a non-verbal communication assignment.  
It demonstrates how GitHub is used in the IT industry to showcase basic programming work and professionalism.

## Description
The `hello.py` file contains a simple Python program that displays a greeting message.  
The script is intentionally kept simple to focus on repository structure, file management, and clear documentation rather than complex logic.
